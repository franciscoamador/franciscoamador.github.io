<p id="paragraph"><br>I was born on January 11, 2003 in San Jose. All of my life I have lived on the exact same street in San Leandro. I am going to be a sophomore at San Lorenzo High school. When I grow up I want to pursue a career in film. I am currently taking a film class in school, and I know how to edit video, as well as use photoshop. I have also taken a few acting classes to help in case I need to be an actor in my own film, but I'm mainly interested in everything that goes on behind the scenes like editing, writing, and directing movies and tv shows. I am a very quiet person around new people, but once I start getting comfortable, it feels like I'm a completely different person. </p>
